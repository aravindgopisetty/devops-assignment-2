🚀 Overview of Devops assignment 2

This project showcases the end-to-end automation of a modern DevOps pipeline for a web-based application.

Here’s how the workflow operates:

A developer pushes the latest code updates or new features to the develop branch in GitHub.

A GitHub webhook immediately notifies the Jenkins server about the new commit.

Jenkins automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

The pipeline builds a new Docker image of the application.

The image is tagged and pushed to Docker Hub, serving as the container registry.

Jenkins then connects to the Kubernetes cluster and updates the application deployment with the latest image.

Kubernetes performs a rolling update, ensuring that the new version is deployed seamlessly without any downtime.

🧰 Tech Stack Used

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Containerization: Docker and Docker Hub

Continuous Integration / Delivery: Jenkins

Orchestration & Deployment: Kubernetes (via Docker Desktop)

1.🧭 Version Control and Branching (Git)

Effective version control is the backbone of this DevOps workflow. Git ensures that every code change is tracked, collaborative development is smooth, and rollbacks are simple if needed.

🪄 Process:

A local Git repository is initialized to manage the source code.

The repository is connected to GitHub for remote collaboration and backup.

The GitFlow branching strategy is used to maintain clean and stable code throughout the development lifecycle.
